PART OF COURSE IMES,IAM,RWTH.
Computational methodology to monitor and predict defects caused in a production systems  
The data is collected from sensor reading recorded through smartphone for 5 different cases in a lab scaled production system.
Overall data pool is compilation of 9 different teams's data.
Case_Comp.mlx is matlab live script that is used to compare different cases.
Data_Comp.mlx is matlab live script that is used to compare different team data.
Projcode.mlx is the maincode of the project that contains preprocessing(noise filter,resampling) ,FFT ,feature extraction and data preparation for ML Classifier.
Random_forest_classifier_IMES_group8.ipynb contains the RFC used for classifying defects caused by inclination and dampener in system.
